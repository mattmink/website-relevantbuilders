<p>As we near completion, we walk through your entire home with you and create a “punch list” of items to complete to make sure everything is just as you envisioned it. Nate likes to say, “We’ll be here for 20 weeks, you’ll be here for 20 years.” We want to give your home the care and attention it deserves. And when we hand you the keys, we don’t just walk away for good. If you ever need us down the road, just give us a call.</p>
